The initial stage of the Compact AI™ process is for leaders to identify and frame an urgent problem that they are going to work on during the process. 

<br/>
The problem of choice must have the following characteristics:

* Categorized as an issue with the core business, business context or people management

* Must be top priority

* Just beyond the reach of current capabilities to establish a solution

* Can be solved by collection, processing and leveraging data within resource constraints

<br/>
It is critical to get this first step right to reap the benefits of Compact AI™ on an ongoing basis. 

<br/>
The following reasons justify the importance of identifying the right problem to solve with Compact AI™:

* Productive: Nothing engages top teams to learn, adapt and grow like a business problem that they must solve

* Polygonal: The laser-sharp focus on solving a vital business problem by developing the organization from inside out gives leaders and their teams the capabilities required to tackle many such challenges

* Profound: The way leaders and their teams frame the problem during the Compact AI™ process reveals how they actually feel and act while tackling the issue at hand. The Compact AI™ process thus enables us to correct fundamental mistakes that are preventing organizations from properly leveraging Enterprise AI.
