###Part 2: Possession - The Key to Basketball Analytics

What is the right way to compare apples to oranges? By looking at the constituents. For example, we can ask what is
the amount of carbohydrates for every 100 calories of apples or oranges. The same logic applies to basketball 
analytics as well. We must have a benchmark metric that we can use to level all the teams. Otherwise, the comparison
of teams does not make sense as every team has its own unique players and gameplay. Then, what is common to all the 
basketball teams ? The common factor is that the teams need to score as many points as it can. How can a team score
points ? By taking possession of the ball from the opponent team. Therefore, the necessary condition to score points
is to take possession of the ball. A team with no possessions would have no points. Also, if a team has more possession
it is not implied that it is a better team. The total number of possessions for teams in the NBA '19 - '20 season is 
shown below.

It is evident from the above figure that the Phoenix Suns had the most number of possessions (3977) in the
NBA '19 season. The closest team in terms of total possessions was the Dallas Mavericks. But the Mavericks were behind
the Suns by about 150 possessions. Yet the Mavericks clinched a playoff spot in the Western Conference, but the 
Suns failed to make the playoffs. The Suns had a win percentage of only 47% while the Mavericks had a win percentage of
57%. Without considering possessions, we would give a lot less credit to the Mavericks than they deserved. In spite of
having lesser number of possessions than the Suns, the Mavericks had a 10% better win percentage. The more the number of
points a team scores per unit possession the more skilled that team is. 
<br/><br/>
We now understand the significance of possessions in the game of basketball. But how do we calculate possessions? 

> Possessions = (Field Goal Attempts - Offensive Rebounds) + Turnovers + (scaling factor * Free Throw Attempts)

<br/><br/>
Let us analyze the above formula. The first term is (Field Goal Attempts - Offensive Rebounds). Field Goal Attempts is 
the primary form of ball possession. However, Offensive Rebounds are subtracted to give credit to teams that have 
more number of Offensive Rebounds. Even with the same number of field goal attempts, a team that has more number of
Offensive Rebounds should be considered as the better team. To further illustrate this point, we go back to our 
comparison of the Suns and the Mavericks. Both the Suns and the Mavericks have comparable number of Field Goal Attempts
for the NBA '19 -'20 season. However, the Mavericks made about 40 Offensive Rebounds more than the Suns. Therefore, the 
Mavericks have a lower number of Possessions compared to the Suns. Furthermore the Mavericks performed better than the 
Suns in that season. 
<br/><br/>
The second term in the formula is Turnovers. This is a relatively straightforward addition to Possessions. Interestingly,
Brooklyn Nets, the team that we started our article with, had the most number of Turnovers in the NBA '19 - '20 season. 
Orlando Magic had the lowest number of Turnovers, lagging behind the Nets by about 150 Turnovers. Yet, both the 
Nets and the Magic clinched playoff spots in that NBA season.
<br/><br/>
The last term in the Possessions formula is Free Throw Attempts multiplied by a scaling factor. Free Throw Attempts are 
not counted under Field Goal Attempts. However, some Free Throw Attempts are linked to Possession. Hence Field Goal 
Attempts is added to the Possessions formula. What is debatable is the fraction of Field Goal Attempts that can be
considered Possessions. Free Throws can be awarded to a NBA team for a variety of reasons, including foul while attempting 
a basket, three-point or four-point play, penalty situation etc. Thus statisticians have empirically calculated that 
40% of Free Throw Attempts convert to Possessions. Therefore the scaling factor is 0.4. 

Let us look at the distribution of Possessions per NBA game in the figure below.

The median of the number of Possessions per game is about 100. This makes sense. If you look at NBA advanced team 
statistics like offensive and defensive efficiency, those are expressed per 100 possessions by the team. Only 17 out of
the total 1059 games had more than 115 possessions for the home team. The quartiles about the median (eg. the second and
the third quartiles) range from 95 to 104 possessions. 

In the next part, we will explore how Possessions can be used to calculate advanced team statistics.
